# Feature Parity with JPA Buddy

### Entity Generation
- Allow users to generate JPA entities from database tables or existing classes.

### Entity-to-Table Mapping
- Implement tools to assist in configuring the mappings between entities and database tables, including annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@OneToMany`, etc.

### JPQL Query Generation
- Add the ability to generate or validate JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries.

### Migration Scripts
- Implement tools to assist in generating database migration scripts (similar to Flyway or Liquibase).

### Validation & Code Generation
- Offer validation for entity classes and automatic generation of getters/setters, constructors, etc.

### Reverse Engineering
- Add reverse engineering from database tables to generate entities or repositories.

# Backend Components

### Entity Generation Engine
- Use a Java process (possibly leveraging a Maven/Gradle task) to handle the JPA entity generation and reverse engineering.

### Database Connectivity
- Use JDBC or another database library to connect to databases and fetch schema details.

### Query Validation and Execution
- Add backend code to validate and optionally execute JPQL queries.

---

# Frontend Integration

### Database Schema & Entity Mapping UI
- Provide a UI for browsing the database schema, creating JPA entities, and mapping relationships. We are using the VS Code Webview API for this.

### Command Palette Integration
- Implement a command palette for JPA-related commands like "Generate Entity from Table," "Generate JPQL Query," etc.
